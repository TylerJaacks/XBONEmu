## Disclaimer

The goal of this project is to experiment, research, and educate on the topic

illegal activity**. All information is obtained via reverse engineering of
legally purchased devices and games and information made public on the internet
(you'd be surprised what's indexed on Google...). We are not any way affliated
with Microsoft.
